🛫 Employee Travel & Demographics Analysis

This project combines employee travel data with U.S. city demographics to uncover actionable insights on spending behavior, travel destinations, and population statistics. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly), the analysis answers key business questions and transforms raw data into clear, engaging visuals.

📂 Project Overview

The analysis addresses real-world organizational questions, such as:

👔 Which employees spent above their allocated stipends

🏙️ What locations were most visited (city & state)

💰 How much did Troy Tippett spend, and what are the demographics of his destination

🌴 How many employees visited Florida, and what’s the male vs female population there

🎖️ Which state has the most veterans, and which employees traveled there

👥 What’s the gender breakdown of the most populated U.S. city

🧍 How many veterans exist in the state visited by Evan Clarke

📅 Which month had the most travels

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
